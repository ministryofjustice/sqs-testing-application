# Ministry of Justice - SQS Tester

This is a Spring Boot application that allows the testing of SQS queues across various environments.

## Developer setup

### Pre-requisites

1. An editor/IDE of some sort (The guide below is for IntelliJ IDEA)
2. Gradle
3. Java 17 JDK

### To get the application running locally

1. Run 'git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/sqs-testing-application.git .'
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Set the SDK for the project. If using IntelliJ, Go to 'File' -> 'Project Structure' and set the SDK to JDK 17.
4. Add configuration for the project. If using IntelliJ, go to 'Run' -> 'Edit Configurationsâ€¦' and add a new configuration for this project by clicking the '+' icon in the top left. Choose 'Spring Boot', and set your JDK to 17, your module to 'sqs-tester.main', and the main class to 'uk.gov.justice.laa.crime.microservice.sqstester.SqsTesterApplication'.
5. Run the application.
6. Test it works by sending a POST request to 'http://localhost:8080/send-message' (change port if required). You could do this using Postman, or using the Swagger documentation. You can do this by going to http://localhost:8080/api-documentation.html, and expanding the 'POST /send-message', and hitting 'Try it out'. You'll need to provide the username and password here.
7. If you decide to test it using Postman (or something else) instead of testing through Swagger as described above, don't forget to set Content-Type header to 'application/json' in your request, and select 'Basic Auth' with the username and password. An example of the structure of the request data can be found in the test folder of the project, under 'test' -> 'resources' -> 'data' -> 'sqstester' -> 'case_default.json'.

## Additional documentation

1. Swagger documentation of the application can be viewed at: http://localhost:8080/api-documentation.html (change port if required).
2. You can find a sequence diagram of the requests that are sent to/from the application within the 'resources' -> 'documentation' folder. If this documentation needs to be modified, it was generated using PlantUML. The txt file within this directory is the file that is used by PlantUML to generate the diagram.
